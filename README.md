# Personal Portfolio - Samantha Thompson

A personal portfolio to showcase my experience, projects, and technical skills.  This project uses TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
