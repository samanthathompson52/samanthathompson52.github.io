                Software Engineer & Techinical Project Manager
                <br></br><br></br>
                Working professionally as a software enginner for the past three years, I have had the privilege of contributing to a diverse range of projects. The rapid evolution of technology and its limitless applications continue to inspire me. I have led initiatives across various sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, and non-profit organizations. Outside of coding, I am passionate about reading and writing fantasy, as well as enjoying video and board games. It has always been my childhood dream to open a board game caf√©!
